ndp -> share the state between compte and storage  -> heeterogeneit (ARM+x8, trstzone + sgx)


VERY IMPORTANT
ndp is needed for performance, ndp is also needed to skip the issue of small memory space of SGX enclaves, thus we need to show that with NDP
-- we are able to run something that is bigger than what can fit SGX (thus, the next one is not important)
-- by providing freshness, ... , we can still get better performance with NDP (thus, the previous is not important_)



title:
too generic, there are several ndp architectures, will this apply to every ndp arch? I am not super sure, for sure this applies to computational storage

8th of Jan
does this applies to SGX host + SGX server?
